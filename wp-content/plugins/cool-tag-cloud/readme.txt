Special thanks to [Orman Clark](http://www.premiumpixels.com/freebies/tagtastic-tag-cloud-psd/) for the tag image and to [Dimox](http://dimox.name/beautiful-tags-markup/) for the CSS code.


== Installation ==

2. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress.
3. Add the plugin's widget on the `Appearance\Widgets` page.
4. That's all.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why is the font size limited to 17px? =

Because when a larger font size is set, the tag text does not fit into the tag image.

Yes, please send your localization files (.mo и .po) to rlector@gmail.com.
